# Mind Fuel

## Objectives
The main objective of this site was to provide a clean, simple platform for learning about editorial and tutoring services offered by Krystal Williams and contacting her for these services.

## Technical Learning Opportunities
The most significant learning opportunities for this project include:
* Responsiveness on multiple screen sizes, including adjusting image and text sizing
* Landing page animation
* Hamburger icon menu for smaller screens - this was my first exposure to this feature, and I relied on guidance from W3Schools for creating [Responsive Top Navigation](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp)

## Future Optimizations
* Scheduling - In the future, I would like integrate a scheduling calendar feature so users can reserve an available timeslot
* Payment Portal - I would like to offer users the opportunity to pay online by integrating PayPal, Stripe, and/or Venmo.
